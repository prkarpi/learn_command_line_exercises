I created a new file in terminal using 'touch' command; created a new 'tmp' directory; then I copied like so:

(master) Nick Vass
Vassio-Book:chapter_10 $ cp foo.txt tmp/

(master) Nick Vass
Vassio-Book:chapter_10 $ ls
foo.txt    footwo.txt tmp

(master) Nick Vass
Vassio-Book:chapter_10 $ cd tmp

(master) Nick Vass
Vassio-Book:tmp $ ls
foo.txt

(master) Nick Vass
Vassio-Book:tmp $
