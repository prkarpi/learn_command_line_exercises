> Can you cd into the temp directory?

I 'cd' to get to home working directory and then  two levels down to:

Vassio-Book:/ $ ls
Applications              bin                       net
Library                   cores                     private
Network                   dev                       sbin
System                    etc                       tmp
Users                     home                      usr
Volumes

In this directory I will type "cd temp" - it will take me to temp directory.

No quiet sure the question, but we can "cd temp" to the temp directory.

> Can you go to the slash temp directory?

  I understand the question - we've talked about this. There is a difference between 'tmp' and 'temp' directories. Also there is a 'tmp' directory in our chapter_5 directory. (I hope this answers this question). 

> Can you go to the slash temp slash log directory?

In OSX we can access log dir by typing in "cd temp/log" - it will put us in the log dir.

".." will jump one level down when used in conjunction with cd such as "cd .."  


bullet point answers:
1. cd temp/stuff/things/frank/joe
2. cd ../../../../
3. not sure what is meant by home dir, but from temp dir I would do the following: ../../../../../../..
4. to get to Documents we need to "cd" to root and then type in "cd ~/Documents"
5. to get to Downloads we do "cd .." (from Documents), then cd ~/Downloads.
6. I decided to "cd" to applications from Documents dir; I "cd .." to root and then "cd ~/Applications"
7.
